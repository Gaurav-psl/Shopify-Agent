"""
appwrite_client.py
-------------------
Appwrite connection setup — the equivalent of your database.py, but
there's no engine/session lifecycle to manage. You configure the client
once, and every request just calls the Databases service directly.

Required environment variables (from your Appwrite Project Settings):
  APPWRITE_ENDPOINT     - e.g. "https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1"
  APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID   - your Project ID
  APPWRITE_API_KEY      - a server-side API key with databases.* scopes
  APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID  - the Database ID you created inside the project
